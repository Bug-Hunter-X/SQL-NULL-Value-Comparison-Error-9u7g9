The correct SQL query to find customers with NULL email addresses is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE email IS NULL;
```
This uses the `IS NULL` operator, which is designed to specifically test for the absence of a value (NULL).  Furthermore, you can combine this with other conditions using `AND` or `OR` operators, ensuring correct data retrieval even with missing values.
